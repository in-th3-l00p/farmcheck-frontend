#### How to plant

1. ###### If starting seeds outdoors, sow seeds 1/2-inch deep and 3 inches apart. Once seedlings reach a height of 2 to 3 inches, thin them so that plants are 12 to 20 inches apart.
2. ###### If you started seeds indoors, plant transplants that are 4 to 6 weeks old (and have 4 or 5 leaves) outdoors, 12 to 20 inches apart, in holes slightly deeper than their container depth.
3. ###### Space rows of broccoli 3 feet apart. (Closer spacing yields smaller main heads, but more secondary heads.). Water well at the time of planting.
