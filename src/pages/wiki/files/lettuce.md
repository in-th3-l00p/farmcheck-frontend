#### How to plant

1. ###### Plant seeds 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch deep. Lettuce seeds need light to germinate, so don’t sow them too deep.
2. ###### Seed may be sown in single rows or broadcast for wide row planting (loose-leaf varieties are best for this). When broadcasting, thin 1- to 2-inch tall seedlings for the proper spacing.
3. ###### Set rows of lettuce 12 to 15 inches apart. Sow additional seeds every 2 weeks for a continuous harvest.
4. ###### Water thoroughly with a mist nozzle at time of transplanting or seeding.
